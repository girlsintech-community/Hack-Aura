    question: "What is a Hackathon?",

  },
  {
    question: "Who can participate?",
    answer: "If you're a student (any course, any year, any college or any COUNTRY), you're IN. Just be ready to code, and maybe go slightly feral at 3 AM over a bug."
  },
  {
    question: "Team size?",
    answer: "Max: 5 Min: 1 There’s a catch! – There SHOULD be at least one Girl in the Team !! If team size is 1 then solo female participants are only allowed!!"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I team up with people from other colleges/branches/years?",
    answer: "Yes, yes and YES!!! You can absolutely team up with anyone who’s also a student."
  },

  },
  {
    question: " Can we code before the hackathon starts?",
    answer: "A BIG NO. No pre-coding is allowed. You can brainstorm, make a figma, or even build your team playlist, but the actual coding starts only when we say so! We will check your commit history."
  },

    question:"Are there prizes?",
    answer: "Will be revealed soon…"
